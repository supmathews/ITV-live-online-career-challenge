# ITV Live Online Career Challenge
## How do ITV promote content on their new streaming platform ITVX effectively to their viewers?

### Overview:
ITV have just launched their new streaming platform ITVX and have commissioned new shows by partnering with third parties such as Warner brothers to expand the breadth of ITVX content and the number of hours available to watch (from 3,000 to 15,000!).

### Step Up Challenge:
With ~30+ million registered users at ITV, how can we ensure that they discover this new great content, increase the number of hours they stay on the platform and are aware of the new features that ITVX has to offer?
